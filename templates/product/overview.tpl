		<p>We work with them on a regular basis and they provide us manpower rather than deliverables. It’s not project based. We work in sprints and for each sprint we have a deliverable. There’s always something more happening.</p>
		<p>Beyond that, they ran several rounds of load testing for us to see that our production environment scales well. We ran a mobile application QA session, too.</p>
		<h3>What is the team composition?</h3>
		<p>There are 11 people from their team who are like an extension of our company, working onsite with us. They recruited people according to our requirements: QA testers and frontend developers who worked in React and JavaScript. The automaton Python developers came from them directly. The team is permanent until we decide we don’t want someone to continue.</p>
